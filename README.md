This is a Rust implementation of the code in Peter Shirley's [*Ray Tracing In One Weekend*](https://in1weekend.blogspot.com/2016/01/ray-tracing-in-one-weekend.html).
I've tried to remain fairly faithful to the C++ code presented there, which has led to some (rather strange) contortions in the Rust code.
